#+TITLE: PROG2002 -- Computer Graphics
#+SUBTITLE: -- Exam Autumn 2020 --

* Preliminary notes:

- *Read this document entirely before you start*
- *The exam will be carried out individually, NOT in groups.*
- *Questions during the exam:*
  + Any question must be posted via the [[https://git.gvk.idi.ntnu.no/course/prog2002/Exams/autumn2020/-/issues][Exam issue tracker]]. Questions not posted
    in the issue tracker will be ignored. Questions and answers will be visible
    by all the exam attendants.
  + The purpose of the question cannot be other than clarifying on the tasks of
    the exam. We don't provide help to solve problems of any type.
- *Preparing an exam repository*
  + In order to start your exam:
    - Fork this repository.
    - Make the forked repository *private*.
    - Give access to the teaching team as *maintainers*:
      + Rafael Palomar.
      + Mekides Assefa Abebe.
      + Leon Cinquemani.
- *Use of code and libraries:*
  + You can make use of the code *your group* developed during the assignments.
  + The OpenGL standard and the libraries employed will be the same used in the
    assignments. Ask the teaching team if you would like to use any other
    library.
- *Use of issue tracker and git:* Throughout the exam we expect that you use
  your forked repo's issue tracker. Open issues for the bodies of work you are
  planning. Indicate with a tag (e.g., =Working=) what you are currently working
  on. Commit often, we expect about 1 commit per hour. This helps both you,
  making less likely that you lose work done, and us, reducing the possibility
  of plagiarism.

* Deliverables and deadlines
- D1 :: Registration in the exam wiki -- **Deadline Dec, 7th 11.59am**. You need to 1) register the url of our repository; 2) make sure your repository has **private** visibility; an 3) Check the oral exam slot and contact the teaching team (e-mail) if you cannot make it at the appointed time.
- D2 :: Self-evaluation issue in your issue tracker -- **Deadline Dec, 10th 8:59am**. Copy [[https://git.gvk.idi.ntnu.no/course/prog2002/Exams/autumn2020/-/issues/1][issue #1]] from the Exam repository to your own exam repository for using it as a template/.
- D3 :: Repository with your exam -- **Deadline Dec, 10th 08.59am**.


* Introduction

The topic of the exam is rendering of a landscape. The terrain will be based on
a gray-scale [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap][heightmap]]. The scene should be either textured, or setting a
sensible color depending on the elevation. The landscape should, at least, have
a forest line (and additionally a lake). The scene should be lit by sunlight
(additionaly in a day/night cycle). The scene should contain 3D models moving in
the scene. Interaction mechanisms to explore the scene should be provided (i.e.,
free navigation of the scene with the mouse and keyboard).

* Tasks

There are *3 tasks*, each consisting of (a) main task and (b) additional
features. Each main tasks has the same scoring weight. To pass the exam, at
least *two* of the main tasks need to be completed. To increase the grade you
need to address all the three main tasks. There are additional features that can
give extra points (up to 10% of the exam grade). To some degree, these
additional features can compensate for some partially-solved main tasks (be
aware that the weight of the main tasks is greater than the additional features:
*good additional features won't compensate for bad main tasks*).

** Task 1: Scene rendering

*** Main task

- [ ] Load one of the heightmaps provided as a resource in this repository.
- [ ] Create the geometry of the scenario based on the heightmap. /The height
  representation does not need to correspond to actual geographic metrics, but
  it should be distinguisable for the observer./
- [ ] Assign colors depending on the elevation level. /You can stratify
  in levels (e.g, brown for the lowest levels, green for medium
  levels, white for high-elevation; you can choose your own colors)./
- [ ] Illuminate the scene modeling sunlight by using the Phong model (ambient +
  diffuse + specular). TIP: a, way to compute normals can be found [[https://stackoverflow.com/q/13983189][here]].

*** Alternative main task

- _If you are unable to load and render the terrain based on heighmaps_ you can
  generate a flat terrain. With this option you will only obtain 25% on this
  task and, to some extent, it will penalize you in task 3.


*** Additional features

- [ ] Implement a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skybox_(video_games)][Skybox]].
- [ ] Add different textures to the terrain.
- [ ] Implement water (e.g., lakes, rivers, ponds).
- [ ] Implement rain or snow.
- [ ] Implement shadowing.

** Task 2: Moving cameras and lights

*** Main task

- [ ] Implement a free-moving camera. Orientation is controlled by the mouse and
  movement is controlled by the WASD keys.
- [ ] Implement day/night cycle. The colours should change throughout the cycle:
  white ad midday, yellowish at evening/morning and red/oragne at dusk/dawn; set
  night light to some dim ambient dark blue color (or any other color choice).
- [ ] Make a perspective switch (3rd person and 1st person). 3rd person should
  follow one of the moving objects of task 3, as well as let you change the
  angle of view.

*** Additional features

- [ ] Add a mini-map showing the position of the viewer in the scenario (for 1st person).
- [ ] Allow the user to control the speed of day/night cycle using a GUI.
- [ ] Integrate zooming functionality for the camera (e.g., in 1st person, left
  mouse button will zoom to the center of the scene).
- [ ] Add underwater effect (e.g., when the viewer is underwater the color
  becomes blue; you can add fog effect underwater).
- [ ] Add specular highlights on the water surface. You may use [[https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Normal-Mapping][normal mapping]].


** Task 3: Placement of objects

*** Main task

- [ ] Populate the scenario with trees in the intermediate heights of the map
  (green areas). There should be at least a few scattered over the scenario
  (models are provided with the resources in this repository).
  /The grade of this point will depend on the complexity of your solution./
- [ ] Populate the scenario with at least one type of movable aerial object
  (eagle and plane provided in the resources). The objects will move randomly in
  its own environment (air) in 2D or in 3D.
- [ ] Similarly to the previous point, populate the scenario with movable ground
  objects. There are object provided in the resources (moose, deer). The models
  should move ramdomly around in their own natural environment (ground). Ground
  objects need to avoid moving through the ground, as well as avoid collition
  with other movable objects and trees.**Note:** if you chose the alternative
  task 1, you will only obtain a maximum of 50% of the score in this point.

*** Additional features:

- [ ] Enable 3D movement of aerial objects (always in the air).
- [ ] Include water objects (fish, duck). The fish should move underwater and
  can move in 2D (similar to aerial objects). The duck should move on the
  surface of water.

* Programming and code management

In addition to the features described in the tasks and additional features, we
will evaluate the quality of the code developed:

** Structure
- The code is separated in meaningful units (.h and .cpp files, possibly
  compiled in separate libraries and linked together according to
  functionality).
- Correct CMake project definition.

** Design
- The design of your solution is sensible, elegant and efficient.

** C++
- Clean and clear code.
- Meaningful use of modern C++ features.
- Efficient code.

** Documentation
- Code documentation.
- Readme file with documentation on how to build and use the software.


* Penalties may be applied in the following circumstances:

- OpenGL errors.
- Unefficient coding.
- Memory leaks.
- Use of old OpenGL standards.
- Other errors.
